## Introduction

EyeGuide AI Enhanced is an assistive technology application designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings, read text, and quickly send emergency alerts. The project combines computer vision, machine learning, text recognition, and user interface design to create an accessible tool that enhances independence and safety for users with visual impairments.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 285 million people are visually impaired worldwide, with 39 million being blind and 246 million having low vision. The majority of these individuals face significant challenges in daily activities including navigation, reading, and emergency communication. EyeGuide AI Enhanced addresses these challenges by leveraging modern technology to provide real-time environmental information and assistance.

## Problem Statement

Individuals with visual impairments face three major challenges that this project aims to address:

1. **Environmental Navigation**: Identifying objects and understanding their spatial relationships is challenging without sight, creating barriers to independent movement and increasing accident risk.

2. **Information Access**: Reading printed or digital text is difficult or impossible without specialized tools, limiting access to written information in daily life.

3. **Emergency Communication**: In emergencies, visually impaired individuals may struggle to quickly communicate their situation and location to emergency contacts.

The project aims to solve these problems through an integrated application that provides:

- Real-time object detection with distance estimation and audio feedback
- Text recognition and reading capabilities for printed and digital text
- A simple, reliable emergency alert system that includes location information

## Literature Review

Several assistive technologies exist for the visually impaired, but each has limitations:

1. **Be My Eyes and Aira**: These apps connect visually impaired users with sighted volunteers or agents but require constant human assistance and internet connectivity.

2. **OrCam MyEye**: A wearable device that can read text and recognize faces but has limited object detection capabilities and high cost ($4,000+).

3. **Microsoft Seeing AI**: A mobile app with object and text recognition but lacking distance estimation and emergency features.

4. **NaviLens**: Provides navigation assistance but requires special markers to be installed in the environment.

Research indicates that effective assistive technologies should:
- Provide real-time feedback through non-visual means (Lahav & Mioduser, 2008)
- Function in varied lighting conditions (Manduchi & Coughlan, 2012)
- Be affordable and accessible (Hersh & Johnson, 2010)
- Integrate multiple functions in a single interface (Fruchterman, 2003)

Our solution builds on this research by combining multiple assistive features in a user-friendly desktop application that does not require constant internet connectivity, uses standard hardware, and provides object distance information that many existing solutions lack.
