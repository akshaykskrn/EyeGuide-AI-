## Advanced Object Detection

This mode identifies objects in your environment and provides voice feedback about what's around you.

### How to Use:

1. Click the "Advanced Object Detection" button
2. The application will activate your camera and begin detecting objects
3. When objects are detected, the application will:
   - Display the objects with bounding boxes on screen
   - Announce the objects and their approximate distances through voice
   - Update the information every 3 seconds
   - Focus on announcing new objects or significant changes in distance

### Tips for Object Detection:

- Good lighting improves detection accuracy
- The detection range works best for objects 1-5 meters away
- The application can detect common objects like people, furniture, appliances, etc.
- Detection works best when objects are fully visible and not obscured
- If there are too many objects, the application will prioritize announcing the closest ones

## Text Recognition and Reading

This mode allows you to capture and read text from documents, books, signs, labels, and screens.

### How to Use:

1. Click the "Text Recognition and Reading" button
2. A new window will open with camera preview
3. Position the camera to frame the text you want to read
4. Click the "Capture Text" button
5. The application will:
   - Process the image to find text
   - Read the detected text aloud
   - Display the text in a window
   - Copy the text to your clipboard for use in other applications

### Tips for Text Recognition:

- Hold the camera steady when capturing text
- Ensure the text is well-lit and has good contrast
- Position the camera so text is straight and fully visible
- For multicolumn documents, capture one column at a time
- Larger text tends to be recognized more accurately
- If using Azure OCR, recognition quality will be higher but requires internet connection

## Emergency SOS Mode

This mode allows you to quickly send emergency messages with your location to a predefined contact.

### How to Use:

1. Click the "Emergency SOS Mode" button
2. The application will activate SOS mode and display instructions
3. In case of emergency, press the SPACE BAR
4. The application will:
   - Determine your approximate location
   - Generate an SOS message with location link
   - Automatically open WhatsApp Desktop
   - Send the message to your emergency contact
   - Provide voice confirmation when completed

### Setting Up Emergency Contact:

Before using SOS mode, make sure to set up your emergency contact:

1. Open `eyeguide_ai_enhanced.py` in a text editor
2. Find the line: `SOS_PHONE_NUMBER = "8073320798"`
3. Replace with your emergency contact's number (include country code)
4. Save the file and restart the application

### Important Notes on SOS Mode:

- Test the SOS feature before relying on it in an emergency
- The WhatsApp automation works best on Windows
- Make sure WhatsApp Desktop is installed and you're logged in
- Location accuracy depends on your internet connection
- The application must have permission to control other applications

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of EyeGuide AI Enhanced by modifying the following settings in the code:

### Appearance:

```python
# UI Colors & Fonts
BG_COLOR = "#121212"         # Background color
FG_COLOR = "#f5f6fa"         # Text color
ACCENT_COLOR = "#00cec9"     # Button color
FONT_NAME = "Segoe UI"       # Font
```

### Performance Settings:

```python
# Camera settings
CAM_WIDTH = 640             # Camera preview width
CAM_HEIGHT = 480            # Camera preview height

# Detection settings
YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.4   # Confidence threshold (0-1)
OBJECT_DETECTION_INTERVAL = 3.0  # Seconds between detections
```

### Text-to-Speech Configuration:

```python
# In the tts_worker function
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Speech speed (words per minute)
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Performance:

1. **Lighting Matters**: Ensure adequate lighting for both object detection and text recognition
2. **Camera Positioning**: Mount or position the camera at eye level for most natural detection
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep Python packages updated for improved performance
4. **Background Noise**: Use headphones in noisy environments to hear announcements better
5. **Battery Life**: When using on a laptop, consider connecting to power for extended sessions

### For Visually Impaired Users:

1. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: The application works well with most screen readers
2. **Voice Rate**: Adjust the speech rate in the code to match your listening preference
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use the Tab key to navigate between buttons
4. **Practice Mode**: Spend time in a familiar environment to learn how the object detection describes your surroundings

### For Caregivers and Assistants:

1. **Initial Setup**: Help with installation and configuration of emergency contact
2. **Environment Mapping**: Walk through familiar environments to help the user understand how objects are described
3. **Regular Testing**: Periodically test the SOS function (without actually sending messages)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The application supports these keyboard shortcuts:

- **SPACE BAR**: Trigger SOS message (when in SOS mode)
- **ESC**: Stop current mode (alternative to clicking "Stop Current Mode")
- **CTRL+Q**: Exit application

## FAQ

### Q: How accurate is the distance estimation?
**A:** The distance estimation is approximate, with accuracy of about Â±15% at 1-3 meters. It is based on the object's apparent size in the frame and works best for known objects of standard sizes.

### Q: Does the application require internet access?
**A:** Basic object detection and text recognition work offline. The Azure OCR (if enabled) and location services for SOS require internet connectivity.

### Q: Can I use the application on a tablet or mobile device?
**A:** The current version is designed for desktop/laptop computers. A mobile version would require adaptation of the code.

### Q: How can I improve text recognition accuracy?
**A:** Enable Azure OCR for better accuracy, ensure good lighting, hold the camera steady, and position text to fill most of the frame.

### Q: The application is not detecting some objects correctly. Why?
**A:** The object detection model (YOLOv8) can detect common objects but may struggle with unusual or partially visible items. Good lighting and positioning can help.

### Q: Can I customize which objects are announced?
**A:** Yes, but it requires modifying the code. Look for the `object_detection_loop` function to add filters for specific object classes.

### Q: Why does the SOS feature only work with WhatsApp?
**A:** The current implementation uses WhatsApp Desktop due to its widespread availability. Future versions could support other messaging platforms.

### Q: Is my data private when using this application?
**A:** Yes. The application processes most data locally on your computer. If using Azure OCR, the images are sent to Microsoft's servers for processing according to their privacy policy.

### Q: How can I report bugs or suggest improvements?
**A:** Please create an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the developer directly.
